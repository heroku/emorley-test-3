## Workflows

### Buildpacks - Prepare Release

Prepares a buildpack release by:
- bumping the fixed version
- updating changelogs
- generating an aggregate changelog from all the changelogs
- opening a PR against the repository with the modified files

You can pin to:
- the [latest release](https://github.com/heroku/languages-github-actions/releases/latest) version with `@latest`
- a [specific release](https://github.com/heroku/languages-github-actions/releases) version with `@v{major}.{minor}.{patch}`
- the development version with `@main`

#### Example Usage

```yaml
name: Prepare Buildpack Releases

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      bump:
        description: "Bump"
        required: true
        default: 'patch'
        type: choice
        options:
          - major
          - minor
          - patch

jobs:
  prepare-release:
    uses: heroku/languages-github-actions/.github/workflows/_buildpacks-prepare-release.yml@latest
    with:
      app_id: ${{ vars.GH_APP_ID }}
      bump: ${{ inputs.bump }}
    secrets:
      app_private_key: ${{ secrets.GH_APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}

```

### Buildpacks - Release

Prepares one or more buildpacks release by:

* Detects all the buildpacks in a repository and compiles them into Cloud Native Buildpacks
* For each compiled buildpack:
  * Creates a CNB archive file from the compiled buildpack and publishes it as a GitHub Release
  * Creates an OCI image from the compiled buildpack and publishes it to Docker
  * Retrieves the OCI image published to Docker Hub and registers this with the CNB Registry
* Once all buildpacks have been published, updates all the buildpack references found in [heroku/builder](https://github.com/heroku/builder)
  for the given list of builders and opens a pull requests containing all the changes to be committed.

You can pin to:
- the [latest release](https://github.com/heroku/languages-github-actions/releases/latest) version with `@latest`
- a [specific release](https://github.com/heroku/languages-github-actions/releases) version with `@v{major}.{minor}.{patch}`

## Development

Custom actions are written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and compiled into a command-line application that
exposes the following sub-commands:

```
Usage: actions <COMMAND>

Commands:
  generate-buildpack-matrix  Generates a JSON list of buildpack information for each buildpack detected
  generate-changelog         Generates a changelog from one or more buildpacks in a project
  prepare-release            Bumps the version of each detected buildpack and adds an entry for any unreleased changes from the changelog
  update-builder             Updates all references to a buildpack in heroku/builder for the given list of builders
  help                       Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
```
